# Potential Marine Aquaculture Suitability for Oysters in West Coast United States' Economic Exclusive Zones
## Overview
This repository contains an rmarkdown document and associated r scripts for analyzing the suitability of Economic Exclusive Zones (EEZ) off the West Coast of the United States for marine aquaculture. The analysis focuses on identifying areas suitable for oyster aquaculture based on sea surface temperatures and depths below sea level. The goal is to provide insights into potential locations for expanding marine aquaculture operations. Additionally, the end of the rmarkdown includes a function, 'analyze_species_suitability;, allowing users to analyze the suitability of EEZs for different species. Users provide the species name and the preferred temperature and depth ranges as inputs to generate maps of total suitable area and percent suitability.

## Background
According to [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/insight/marine-aquaculture#:~:text=Marine%20aquaculture%20provides%20a%20domestic,supports%20our%20wild%20fisheries%20production.), marine aquaculture involves the "breeding, rearing, and harvesting of aquatic plants and animals".
